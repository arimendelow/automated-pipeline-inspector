This project was completed as my senior capstone project. The end goal of the project is to develop a completely autonomous pipeline inspecting robot. In its current form, we have all hardware necessary for complete autonomy and have begun development of the software platform using [ROS](http://www.ros.org). The software, as is in this repository, is capable of controlling the robot with a remote joystick for testing the hardware components. The next step in this project would be to complete the autonomous navigation and inspection portion, which can be done using various ROS libraries.

The MATLAB code is considered proprietary and thus is not published here, however a basic understanding of it can be obtained from the above research paper.
